BATTERY STATUS INDICATOR FOR GNOME CLASSIC
==========================================

Just run
$ python battery_status.py

You can add it to your startup programs to load automatically after each login.

The source is simple and you're welcome to meddle with it.

battery.py is a module for checking the battery state etc.

Icons are converted from standard Ubuntu icons (Mono Dark), only modified to render nicely in gnome-panel. I replaced
'height="24" width="32"'
with
'height="32" width="32" transform="translate(0, 4)"'
in the <svg> element.
